# GC4iOS -  GameCube emulator for Apple iOS

GC4iOS
=======
###### Supports iOS 8.1 and up. 64 bit devices only.

Currently GC4iOS uses Dolphin's PowerPC Interpreter and an OpenGL 3.0 backend. Most games can be loaded and run between 2 and 15 fps. Some games can be loaded and run pretty close to full-speed with overclock. JitARM64 is currently unstable and cannot boot all games at the moment but will in the future.

Devices with 2GB of ram are recommended (iPhone 6s, ect). Devices with 1GB will still work fine but it is recommended to close all applications before using GC4iOS.

Please note this is an early alpha version. Without JIT, the emulator will not be fast enough to play any games at a playable speed.

Installing GC4iOS
------------------------
Download the source and open the project file in the root directory. Set your device as Generic iOS Device and press Archive. Then extract the archive and convert the .app folder into a .ipa file. Install ipa via Cydia Extractor (Latest Version).
